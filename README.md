# Delivery Now!

Rest API for restaurant and delivery.


## How to build

The service is built using `gradle`, so building it is just a matter of running:

```
gradle build

```

If you want to build the docker image, you should run:

```
gradle build docker

```

## How to run

#### Pulling the docker images from the server

I made all the images available in DockerHub, so save this file as `docker-compose.yml`:

```
version: '2.0'

services:

  postgres:
    image: postgres
    restart: always
    environment:
      POSTGRES_USER: delivernow
      POSTGRES_PASSWORD: 123456

  notifications-api:
    image: docker.io/ricardobevi/notifications-api
    restart: always

  delivernow:
    image: docker.io/ricardobevi/deliver-now
    restart: always
    environment:
      SPRING_PROFILES_ACTIVE: prod
    ports:
      - 8081:8081
```

And in the same directory run

```
docker-compose up
```

That should download the images and lunch this service, a postgresql database and a notification service.

#### With local images

You should build an image for [notifications-api](https://github.com/ricardobevi/notifications-api) fist. The steps are the same as for this service.

Then build this project and use the included `yml` file to run 

```
docker-compose up
```

## Notifications API

Fist, you should know that I'm terrible with naming things. Having said that, one requirement was to have a separate service to send SMSs and EMails. This service provides that in a way. Today is just a mock to show the possibility of communication between two services.

You can find this project [here](https://github.com/ricardobevi/notifications-api).

## Endpoints

### /order

Places an order on the given restaurant. 

> WARNING! ETA service will only work if called from my server (listed above). Otherwise the call will fail because it is using an unauthorized IP.

        },

## About the code

This code tries to follow the guidelines suggested in the following books.

> Clean Code: A Handbook of Agile Software Craftsmanship (Robert C. Martin)

Gives guidelines to writing nice code that can be tested and extended with ease.

> Clean Architecture: A Craftsman's Guide to Software Structure and Design (Robert C. Martin Series)

This book introduces the concept of [clean architecture](https://8thlight.com/blog/uncle-bob/2012/08/13/the-clean-architecture.html).

Also, in order to organize my workflow I took advice from:

> Agile Estimating and Planning by Mike Cohn

And also:

> User Stories Applied by Mike Cohn
